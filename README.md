## Project
This project was made exclusively in Java, with default librairies.
We used the IDE IntelliJ to run the project.

The project's aim was to study different algorithms to evaluate their complexity and their real time execution.

We studied the following algorithms :

|**Algorithm**|**Best Complexity**|
|:-:|:-:|
|Kruskal version 1|O( m*log(m) )|
|Kruskal version 2|O( m*log(m) )|
|Prim|O( n² )|
