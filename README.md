## Details
This project was made exclusively in Java, with default libraies.

The project's aim was to study different algorithms to evaluate their complexity and their real time execution.

We studied the following algorithms :

|**Algorithm**|**Best Complexity**|
|:-:|:-:|
|Kruskal version 1|O( m*log(m) )|
|Kruskal version 2|O( m*log(m) )|
|Prim|O( n² )|
